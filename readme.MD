<h1>Project 1 Requirements</h1>

In the key generation program (required for EACH of Options 1, 2, and 3) in the directory “KeyGen”,

1. Create a pair of RSA public and private keys for ```X, Kx+ and Kx–;```
2. Create a pair of RSA public and private keys for ```Y, Ky+ and Ky–;```
3. Get the modulus and exponent of each RSA public or private key and save them into files named ```“XPublic.key”, “XPrivate.key”,
“YPublic.key”, and “YPrivate.key”```, respectively;
4. Take a 16-character user input from the keyboard and save this 16-character string to a file named “symmetric.key”. This string’s 128-bit UTF-8 encoding will be used as the 128-bit AES symmetric key, Kxy, in your application.

Option 2: symmetric-key encrypted message and its digital signature
• In this option, X is the sender and Y is the receiver.
• In the sender’s program in the directory “Sender”, calculate 

```AES-En Kxy (RSA-En Kx– (SHA256 (M)) || M)```

1. To test this program, the corresponding key files need to be copied here from the directory “KeyGen”

2. Read the information on the keys to be used in this program from the key files and generate Kx – and Kxy.

3. Display a prompt “Input the name of the message file:” and take a user input from the keyboard. This
user input provides the name of the file containing the message M. M can NOT be assumed to be a text message. The
size of the message M could be much larger than 32KB.

4. Read the message, M, from the file specified in Step 3 piece by piece, where each piece is recommended to be a small
multiple of 1024 bytes, calculate the SHA256 hash value (digital digest) of the entire message M, i.e., SHA256(M), SAVE
it into a file named “message.dd”, and DISPLAY SHA256(M) in Hexadecimal bytes.

    o An added feature for testing whether the receiver’s program can handle the case properly when the digital digest
    calculated in Step 6 (the receiver’s program) is different from the digital digest obtained in Step 5 (the receiver’s
    program): After calculating SHA256(M) but before saving it to the file named “message.dd” (the sender’s program),
    display a prompt “Do you want to invert the 1st byte in SHA256(M)? (Y or N)”,

    o If the user input is ‘Y’, modify the first byte in your byte array holding SHA256(M) by replacing it with its bitwise
    inverted value (hint: the ~ operator in Java does it), complete the rest of Step 4 by SAVING & DISPLAYING the
    modified SHA256(M), instead of the original SHA256(M), and continue to Step 5 (also use the modified
    SHA256(M), instead of the original SHA256(M), in Steps 5 & 6).

    o Otherwise (if the user input is ‘N’), make NO change to the byte array holding SHA256(M), complete the rest of
    Step 4 (SAVE and DISPLAY), and continue to Step 5.

5. Calculate the RSA Encryption of SHA256(M) using Kx – (Question: how many bytes is the cyphertext?), SAVE this RSA
cyphertext (the digital signature of M), into a file named “message.ds-msg”, and DISPLAY it in Hexadecimal bytes.
APPEND the message M read from the file specified in Step 3 to the file “message.ds-msg” piece by piece.

6. Calculate the AES Encryption of 
```(RSA-En Kx– (SHA256 (M)) || M) ```

using Kxy by reading the file “message.ds-msg” piece by piece, where each piece is recommended to be a multiple of 16 bytes long. (Hint: if the length of the last piece is less than that multiple of 16 bytes, it needs to be placed in a byte array whose array size is the length of the last piece before being encrypted.) SAVE the resulting blocks of AES ciphertext into a file named “message.aescipher”.

    • In the receiver’s program in the directory “Receiver”, using AES and RSA Decryptions to get SHA256 (M) and M, compare
    SHA256(M) with the locally calculated SHA256 hash of M, report hashing error if any, and then save M to a file.

1. To test this program, the corresponding key files need to be copied here from the directory “KeyGen”, and the file
“message.aescipher” needs to be copied here from the directory “Sender”.

2. Read the information on the keys to be used in this program from the key files and generate Kx+ and Kxy.

3. Display a prompt “Input the name of the message file:” and take a user input from the keyboard. The
resulting message M will be saved to this file at the end of this program.

4. Read the ciphertext, C, from the file “message.aescipher” block by block, where each block needs to be a multiple of 16
bytes long. (Hint: if the length of the last block is less than that multiple of 16 bytes, it needs to be placed in a byte array
whose array size is the length of the last piece before being decrypted.) Calculate the AES Decryption of C using Kxy
block by block to get RSA-En Kx- (SHA256 (M)) || M, and save the resulting pieces into a file named “message.ds-msg”.

5. If using "RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding", read the first 128 bytes from the file “message.ds-msg” to get the digital signature
RSA-En Kx- (SHA256 (M)), and copy the message M, i.e., the leftover bytes in the file “message.ds-msg”, to a file whose
name is specified in Step 3. (Why 128 bytes? Why is the leftover M?) Calculate the RSA Decryption of this digital
signature using Kx+ to get the digital digest SHA256(M), SAVE this digital digest into a file named “message.dd”, and
DISPLAY it in Hexadecimal bytes.

6. Read the message M from the file whose name is specified in Step 3 piece by piece, where each piece is recommended to
be a small multiple of 1024 bytes, calculate the SHA256 hash value (digital digest) of the entire message M, DISPLAY it
in Hexadecimal bytes, compare it with the digital digest obtained in Step 5, display whether the digital digest passes the
authentication check.
